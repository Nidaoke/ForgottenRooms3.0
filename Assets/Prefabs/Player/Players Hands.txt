The hands have a 'TFR Hand Script' each, which talks directly to the Hand.cs script from the Oculus Touch plugin. I've made a few changes to the Hands.cs and commented all of them with // TFR Edit so we can easily retrieve them in the future.

The structure is like so:
RightHand
- Hand.cs
- TRFHandScript.cs

-RightCuff
-- TFRRightBracelet.cs
-- RightCuff Buttons 1-3
---Animations for each button
---Audio Source
---TFRRightBraceletDock.cs
---Canvas with Sprites
---Hologram Parent

-Rift Hand
--Animations
--Point Trigger Collidor (With RightHand Tag)

-------------------------------------------------------------

LeftHand
- Hand.cs
- TRFHandScript.cs

-LeftCuff
--TFRLeftCuffManager.cs
--LeftButtons 1 - 3


--Hologram Screen
--- Individual Screens(Which will have individual scripts, WIP).

-Left Hand
--Animations
--Point Trigger Collidor (With LeftHand Tag)
