The Loading Screen scene automatically looks for the Player Prefs 'LoadScene' when it starts, if one is present it will load that scene.
If there is no PlayerPref INT value, it will default to the Main Menu.

Everything is stored under the TFRLoadingScreen script, which is attached to the Loading Screen Manager GameObject.
