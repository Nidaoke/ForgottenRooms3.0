The Startup scene uses one single animation which is on the 'UI Canvas'.
It will fade the company logos in and out, then the disclaimer which are all child objects.

Once the animation is finished, it enables the 'Trigger Event' gameobject which has a 'Active Trigger' attached.
This changes the scene to Scene(1), the Loading Screen scene when activated.
